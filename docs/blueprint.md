## Core Features:

- Welcome Screen: Display a welcome screen with a brief introduction and an 'Initiate Reading' button.
- Tarot Interpretation via Gemini: Simulate an API call to Gemini based on user input or a default prompt, to embody the persona of an experienced Tarot reader and provide insights based on simulated card selections, using the Gemini tool. 
- Reading Display: Present a reading screen displaying three simulated tarot cards (Past, Present, Future) and the AI's interpretation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary colors: Dark greens, ochres, deep burgundy, and touches of antique gold.
- Accent: A muted gold (#B8860B) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions.
- Incorporate curvilinear graphic elements with natural motifs (leaves, stars, mystical smoke lines) as borders and background details.
- Subtle animations, such as a mist or starfield background on the welcome screen, and a 'flipping' effect when revealing tarot cards.
- Use silhouettes or abstract designs inspired by Art Nouveau for the tarot card spaces.
